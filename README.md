Basically trying to solve it not through brute force, but the way that I would solve it.

Can solve any "deducible" puzzle, but won't guess. Next steps would be to add a check if we have done a few loops with no solution say that it isn't
deducible. Also, guess the square with the smallest amount of options. Keep track of guesses and if we have a mistake walk them back one by one.
